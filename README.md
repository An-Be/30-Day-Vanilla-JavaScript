# 30 Day Vanilla JavaScript

I am doing this challenge to brush up on my JavaScript Skils now that I am going to start learning React.

## Day 1

Consisted of making a sound board using vanilla javascript. I wanted to make it my own so I
went with a different sound board and background than was in the original video. I learned about key events, how to play audio, and how to work with transitions. My sound
board contains different anime sounds and looks like this:

## Day 2
Consisted of making a clock using vanilla javascript. I learned about transform in CSS and more about transition. I'd like to add some if statements to remove the transition temporarily because when the clock reaches a minute it resets for a few seconds and then goes back to normal.
