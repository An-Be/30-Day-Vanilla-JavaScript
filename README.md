# 30 Day Vanilla JavaScript

I am doing this challenge to brush up on my JavaScript Skils now that I am going to start learning React.

## Day 1

Consisted of making a sound board using vanilla javascript. I wanted to make it my own so I
went with a different sound board and background than was in the original video. I learned about key events, how to play audio, and how to work with transitions. My sound
board contains different anime sounds and looks like this:

## Day 2
Consisted of making a clock using vanilla javascript. I learned about transform in CSS and more about transitions. I was able to remove and add a class to make the clock run more smoothly using what I learned yesterday.

## Day 3
In Day 3 I had to work with CSS variables for the first time, it was interested feature  I did not know existed. I had a bit of trouble with the tutorial because the code that was being used was not working for me so I had to figure out a different way to access the datasets. Instead of using 
this.dataset I passed a parameter e into my function and used e.target.dataset to access the datasets in my HTML file.

## Day 4

In day 4 I had to work with array methods, this was a bit a refresher but I will for sure be practicing these more because I know they are important when learning react so I really want to get these down. I personally find reduce the most confusing at times but I am pretty comfortable with the other methods like sort, filter, and map.

## Day 5 
I got to work with flex-box which was a great refresher. Flex-box can be confusing at times but it is super helpful in the making of websites, it's a great way to make sure things stay aligned and are in the right place. It's my go to when I have a bunch of items and want to make sure they appear it the correct direction. I also used some more transform/transitions to make a more interactive design. To practice what I have learned I am going to try to incorporate transitions into my personal website to add some interactivity and animations.
