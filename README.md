# 30 Day Vanilla JavaScript

I am doing this challenge to brush up on my JavaScript Skils now that I am going to start learning React.

## Day 1

Consisted of making a sound board using vanilla javascript. I wanted to make it my own so I
went with a different sound board and background than was in the original video. I learned about key events, how to play audio, and how to work with transitions. My sound
board contains different anime sounds and looks like this:

## Day 2
Consisted of making a clock using vanilla javascript. I learned about transform in CSS and more about transitions. I was able to remove and add a class to make the clock run more smoothly using what I learned yesterday.

## Day 3
In Day 3 I had to work with CSS variables for the first time, it was interested feature  I did not know existed. I had a bit of trouble with the tutorial because the code that was being used was not working for me so I had to figure out a different way to access the datasets. Instead of using 
this.dataset I passed a parameter e into my function and used e.target.dataset to access the datasets in my HTML file.
